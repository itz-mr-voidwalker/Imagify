# Imagify 🚀✨
> Imagify — Because converting images is everyone's dream job, right? 🙄🎨

## About 🤷‍♂️
Imagify is your new best friend when you wanna convert images but don’t wanna get your hands dirty with boring stuff. Made with CustomTkinter (for that dark mode swag 🌚) and Pillow (no, not the one you sleep on 🛏️).

Supports all those fancy formats you pretend to know about: PNG, JPEG, WEBP, ICO, TGA, BMP, GIF, TIFF. Basically, all the alphabets. 🅰️➡️🆉

## Features (Because why not) 💅
- Sleek AF UI — Dark mode only, coz bright is too mainstream. 🌑

- Batch conversion — Pick a bunch of images and watch them morph like magic. 🧙‍♂️✨

- Transparency fix — JPEG hates alpha channels like your we hate school. We handle that drama. 💔➡️🤝

- Compression so tight, your images go on a serious diet—file size drops like it's hot, but quality stays chill.

- Fallback to PNG — If it fails, fallback like a pro. No shame. 😎

- Logs everything — ‘Cause if it crashes, we wanna know why. Not like you’ll read it though. 📜🔥

## How to Use This Masterpiece 🕹️
- Install Python, obviously. 🐍

- pip install customtkinter pillow — it’s not rocket science, chill. 🚀

- Run python imagify.py and witness the magic 🧙‍♂️

- Select images like you select your excuses to skip work.

- Pick the format — choose wisely, King 👑

- Click convert and pray it works. 🙏

## Logs 🕵️‍♂️
Logs saved in your temp folder. Perfect place for all your failures to chill. Wanna blame someone? Here’s your evidence. 🕵️‍♀️📂

## Licence
> MIT License — Use it, abuse it, twerk it like you’re the star of some cringe TikTok trend. Remix it, fork it, whatever floats your boat 🚤. Just one tiny favor — don’t blame me if your “masterpiece” crashes harder than your Wi-Fi during online class or if your files vanish like your motivation on Monday mornings. If you mess up, it’s on you, boss. I’m just here for the tea ☕️😎.

## Author 😎
Crafted with peak laziness and maximum sarcasm by 𝓜я. ᴠᴇɴɢᴇᴀɴᴄᴇ (Sai Vignesh) – the one who writes code like he’s solving world hunger, but actually just hates slow conversions 😌💻.

No team, no drama, just one guy and a borderline unhealthy obsession with pixels and Python.
Blame-free, fame-ready, and sleep-deprived since day one. Fork it if you dare 😈🔥
